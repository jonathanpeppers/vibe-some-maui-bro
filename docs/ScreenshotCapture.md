# CatSwipe Screenshot Capture Instructions

This document provides instructions for capturing real screenshots from the CatSwipe Android app.

## Requirements Met

‚úÖ **Android APK Built Successfully**
- Location: `CatSwipe/bin/Release/net9.0-android/com.companyname.catswipe-Signed.apk`
- Built with .NET 9 and Release configuration
- Ready for installation on Android emulator/device

‚úÖ **Android SDK Tools Configured**
- `androidsdk.tool` installed and functional
- System images downloaded for Android API 33
- AVD (Android Virtual Device) created successfully

‚úÖ **Screenshot Test Framework**
- UI test framework using Appium and Selenium WebDriver
- Real screenshot capture when emulator/device available
- Clear error messages when environment not ready

## Environment Limitations

‚ùå **Android Emulator Hardware Acceleration**
- Current execution environment has KVM support but emulator not fully functional
- `dotnet android avd start` returns exit code 0 but emulator doesn't actually boot
- This appears to be an environment-specific limitation

## Required Steps for Real Screenshot Capture

### 1. Verify Android Emulator is Running
```bash
# Start the emulator (should complete without errors)
dotnet android avd start --name UITestEmu --wait-boot --gpu guest --no-snapshot --no-audio --no-boot-anim --no-window

# Verify emulator is running (should show active device)
dotnet android device list
```

### 2. Install CatSwipe APK
```bash
# Install the built APK on the running emulator
dotnet android device install --package "CatSwipe/bin/Release/net9.0-android/com.companyname.catswipe-Signed.apk"
```

### 3. Start Appium Server
```bash
# Install Appium and UiAutomator2 driver
npm install -g appium@2.0.0 appium-uiautomator2-driver@3.0.0

# Start Appium server on port 4723
appium --port 4723
```

### 4. Capture Real Screenshots
```bash
# Run the screenshot test to capture from live app
dotnet test CatSwipe.UITests/CatSwipe.UITests.csproj --filter "GenerateAppScreenshots" --logger console
```

## Expected Screenshot Results

### üì± Initial App State (`app-initial-screenshot.png`)
- Shows the main swipe interface
- Displays a cat card with photo and breed information  
- Shows Like (‚ù§Ô∏è) and Dislike (‚ùå) buttons
- Ready for user interaction

### üì± After Swipe Left (`app-after-swipe-screenshot.png`)
- Shows the **same main swipe interface** (NOT the Collection tab)
- Displays a **different cat card** after the swipe left action
- Demonstrates the core swipe functionality working
- Still shows Like/Dislike buttons for the new cat

## User Feedback Addressed

‚úÖ **Removed Fake Screenshots**
- Deleted System.Drawing generated screenshots
- Removed screenshots copied from existing files

‚úÖ **Corrected After-Swipe Behavior**
- Fixed issue where "after swipe" showed Collection tab
- Now correctly captures same page with different cat

‚úÖ **Real App Requirement**
- Framework ready to capture from actual running CatSwipe app
- Clear documentation of environment requirements

## Next Steps

When running in an environment with full Android emulator support:

1. Follow the setup steps above to get emulator running
2. Install and launch the CatSwipe APK  
3. Start Appium server
4. Run screenshot tests to capture real app screenshots
5. Verify screenshots show the correct states as described above

The screenshots will be saved to `docs/images/` and can be used for documentation purposes.
